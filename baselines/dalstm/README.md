Here, we present our implementation of DALSTM model.  

All data attributes that are used by DALSTM model are included `preprocessing_config.yaml` file. Note that only categorical attributes in event level can be used by DALSTM model. We used the same attributes that are used by PGTNet to have a fair comparison.
