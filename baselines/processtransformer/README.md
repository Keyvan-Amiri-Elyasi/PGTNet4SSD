This directory includes all adjustments required for implementation of ProcessTransformer baseline. 

In order to replicate our experiments with cross-validation data split the implementation of **ProcessTransformer** repository should be adjusted based on the content of this  [**folder**](https://github.com/keyvan-amiri/PGTNet/tree/main/baselines/processtransformer/crossvalidation), while for holdout data split contents of this [**folder**](https://github.com/keyvan-amiri/PGTNet/tree/main/baselines/processtransformer/holdout) are relevant.
