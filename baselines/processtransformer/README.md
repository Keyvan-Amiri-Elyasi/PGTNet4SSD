Here, we present our implementation of ProcessTransformer model.  

In our pipeline, we only implemented preprocessing and holdout data split (training and inference) for seed 42. For cross-fold validation data split, we used three different random seeds to have fair comparison. If you want to use this code in other context or settings, do not remember to adjust the code.
