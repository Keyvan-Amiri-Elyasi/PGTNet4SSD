The main goal of this part of the implementation is to convert an event log into a graph dataset.
Conversion is not required for training GPS graph transformer networks, as we already uplaoded graph datasets used in our study.
Yet, we provide our source code for transparency and to encourage using our proposal for other datasets.

Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `conversion` directory.
