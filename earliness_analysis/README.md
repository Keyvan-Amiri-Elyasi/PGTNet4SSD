Here, we present the results for earliness analysis in separate folders. In the folder **100**, all prefixes all included, and we report MAE for all prefix lengths.  However, plots in this folder might be misleading as they also include outlier lengths which may consist of only few prefixes. Therefore, we decided to limit the prefix length for better visualization. in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06267) we did the same and report the plots up to a length which corresponds to 90% of prefixes. Here, we also provide the results for 80% and 70% of prefixes in separate folders.
